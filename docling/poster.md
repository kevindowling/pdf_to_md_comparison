## The 32 Track MIDI Recorder

The LinnSequencer is a state-of-the-art composition and performance tool for the professional musician. It is extremely powerful, yet amazingly simple to learn and use. Its many remarkable features include:

- Each of the 100 sequences contains 32 simultaneous, polyphonic tracks. Each track may be assigned to one of 16 MIDI channels. Simultaneously plays up to 16 polyphonic synthesizers !
- Operation is similar to multi-track tape recorder with PLAY, STOP, RECORD FAST FORWARD; REWIND; and LOCATE controls.
- Ultra-fast 31/2 disk drive stores complex songs in seconds and holds over 110,000 notes per disk!
- Exclusive real-time ERASE function makes editing FAST.
- One or all tracks may be TRANSPOSED at the touch of a key
- Exclusive REPEAT function automatically repeats any held notes at a pre-selected rhythmic value.
- Optional SMPTE time code synchronization.
- TIMING CORRECTION works during playback and operates without 'chopping' notes.
- Optional remote control.

## Recording a Sequence

The INSERT/COPY function allows you to move bars from one location to another\_in the same sequence or a different one: example; you might insert a copy of the first verse between the second chorus and the bridge DELETE BARS operates the same way to remove unwanted sections. For simply use LOCATE, FAST FORWARD; or REWIND to find the desired bar number; then start recording.

FAST FORWARD; REWIND; and LOCATE controls may be used at any time to quickly access any location in your sequence for spot-recording. To overdub a new part, select a different track and start recording\_while you record, the first track will play in perfect sync (unless you MUTE it, or SOLO another track) . In this way, up to 32 tracks may be overdubbed! All MIDI effects are recorded including pitch bend, modulation, velocity; aftertouch, sustain pedal, and program changes!

## Editing

To record a sequence, simply press RECORD and PLAY, then play your MIDI keyboard in time to the Sequencer's click track. When the sequence loops back around to bar 1, you'll hear what you played only all timing errors will be corrected! (Timing correction may be adjusted or defeated) . Any additional notes played will be added into the track existing notes are not erased while recording !

## Creating a Song

One way to create a song is to record each track all the way through (up to 999 bars) . Another way is to record each basic section (verse, chorus, etc.) in individual sequences, then use the CREATE SONG function to *chain? them together: CREATE SONG will then automatically copy all the parts into a new sequence. If desired, you can even set the last few bars to repeat infinitely; for a fadeout.

## Composition Without Compromise

To erase a note, simply hold ERASE and press the note to be erased just before it plays in the sequence when played back, it will be gone. Notes may also be added, erased, or changed using the SINGLE STEP function. To overdub notes at specific points within a sequence, wrong

The technology you use should never be so complex that it interferes with the creative process. That's precisely why the LinnSequencer is designed to let you compose; record and edit while devoting your undivided attention to your music. See your Linn dealer today for a demonstration!
