## Optical character recognition

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Optical character recognition (optical character reader, OCR) is the mechanical or electronic conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machineencoded text; whether from a scanned document; a photo of a document; a scene-photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example from a television broadcast) [1] It is widely used as a form of information entry from printed paper data records, whether passport printouts of static-data, or any suitable documentation. It is a common method of digitising displayed on-line; and used in machine processes such as cognitive computing, machine translation; (extracted) text-to-speech; key data and text mining. OCR is a field of research in pattern recognition, artificial intelligence and computer vision.

Early versions needed to be trained with images of each character, and worked on one font at a time; Advanced systems capable of producing a high degree of recognition accuracy for most fonts are now common; and with support for a variety of digital image file format inputs [2] Some systems are capable of reproducing formatted output that closely approximates the original page including images; columns, and other non-textual components.

## History

Early optical character recognition may be traced to technologies involving telegraphy and that read characters and converted them into standard telegraph code. Concurrently, Edmund Fournier d'Albe developed the Optophone, a handheld scanner that when moved across a printed page; produced tones that corresponded to specific letters or
