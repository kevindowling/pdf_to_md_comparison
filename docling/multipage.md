It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period, as at this.

In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and   protection to justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and highway   robberies, took   place in the   capital itself every night; families were publicly cau tioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman in the dark was a tradesman in the light, and, recognised and City being
