# The LinnSequencer
## 32 Track MIDI Sequence Recorder

The LinnSequencer is a state-of-the-art composition and performance tool for the professional musician. It is extremely powerful, yet amazingly simple to learn and use. Its many remarkable features include:

- **Operation is similar to multi-track tape recorder with PLAY, STOP, RECORD, FAST FORWARD, REWIND, and LOCATE controls.**
- **Each of the 100 sequences contains 32 simultaneous, polyphonic tracks. Each track may be assigned to one of 16 MIDI channels. Simultaneously plays up to 16 polyphonic synthesizers!**
- **Ultra-fast 3½" disk drive stores complex songs in seconds and holds over 10,000 notes per disk!**
- **One or all tracks may be TRANSPOSED at the touch of a key.**
- **Exclusive real-time ERASE function makes editing FAST.**
- **Exclusive REPEAT function automatically repeats any held notes at a pre-selected rhythmic VALUE.**
- **TIMING CORRECTION works during playback and operates without ‘chopping’ notes.**
- **Optional SMPTE time code synchronization.**
- **Optional remote control.**

## Recording a Sequence

To record a sequence, simply press RECORD and PLAY, then play your MIDI keyboard into the Sequencer's, disk. When you begin playback—no errors round to be! If you track what you played—only timing errors will be corrected! (Timing correction may be adjusted or disabled). 

Any additional notes played while recording into the track—ASSIST FORWARD, REWIND, and LOCATE—may be used at any time to quickly access a location for your sequence for proper positioning. To override a part, select a different track and play in record mode while you MUFF it, or should another riff emerge, this way up to 32 tracks may be assembled! All MIDI edits are recorded including pitch bend, modulation, velocity, aftertouch, sustain pedal, and program changes!

## Editing

To erase a song note, simply hold ERASE and press the note you want to delete while playing the sequence—when you've heard it, just hit the way it should be noted, erased, or changed with the SINGLE STEP function. To overwrite notes at specific points within a sequence, simply use LOCATE, FAST FORWARD, or REWIND to find the desired bar number, then start recording.

The INSERT/COPY function allows you to move bars from one location to another—the same sequence may be a different one. For example, you might insert a copy of the first three bars between the second and the fifth. DELETE BARS operation the same way to remove unwanted sections.

## Creating a Song

Now that you created a sequence, you can start to use it to create songs. A song is made up of several sequences, each one in their individual "chain" sequences. Use the CREATE SONG such as a "chaining" setup for all the sequences you created! If desired, you can even set the last bar in a sequence intensifies, for a fadeout.

## Composition Without Compromise

The interesting thing about the LinnSequencer is the complexity that filters with the creative process. That’s precisely what the LinnSequencer is designed to do—whatever your musical style and you don't have to compromise, you and while you're adding your individual attention to your music.
